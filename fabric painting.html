       <div id="text"><blockquote class="text_design">Fabric painting is a way of building colourful pictures and designs with paints and brushes.<br><br>At present - fabric painting is considered one of the simplest ways to paint one’s own fabric.  It has the potential to transform a lacklustre and plain fabric into something special with the use of brushes and paints.<br><br>Let us take a look at some simple techniques of fabric painting using which you can learn this creative hobby.<br><br><br><br><b>Fabric Painting techniques for Beginners </b><br><br>Are you fond of designs but are not sure how to do fabric painting?

       <h1 id="text1">Freehand Painting </h1><img src="images\56.jpg" class="more_ideas_image">For someone who has the natural ability of painting with a steady hand, this style of painting is the easiest to start with. Learning Freehand painting method will help you create some easy fabric painting designs with minimal effort and resources.<br><br>Freehand painting does not necessitate the use of a large amount of paint; a liberal amount of it can do the trick for you. However, working out the rough outline of a design is one of the imperative to obtain desirable results in this form of painting.<br><br>The rules for it are pretty simple and straightforward: focus on the dark shades and background images, to begin with. Next, you can lay emphasis on the parts that are more likely to get light. Use lighter shades to colour them.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
       <h1 id="text1">Dot Painting </h1><img src="images\57.jpg" class="more_ideas_image">What if you could transform your plain old clothing into polka dotted beauty using Dot painting!<br><br>Dot painting is a technique in which ‘dots’ are marked or imprinted repeatedly to form a pattern, design and style.<br><br>Dot painting, which is a modification of dot mandala, makes use of a pencil’s backend to design eye-catching dots of various shades.<br><br>It is a simple and easy-to-learn fabric painting technique that people like to see and try. Check out these dot painting tips for beginners!<br><br>Alternatively, you can also utilize simple ear buds to achieve the same results. You do not essentially need the expensive ones; you can do the job with the inexpensive variants of ear buds as well.<br><br>For a beading effect, use silver or gold as these metallic shades are known to boost the appearance of bead embroidery items.<br><br><br> 
       <h1 id="text1">Outliner Painting </h1><img src="images\58.jpg" class="more_ideas_image">Used extensively with glass painting designs, Outliner painting is a simple yet effective version of fabric painting which may either be colourful or without any colour. Either way, it not only looks palatable to the eye but also makes for a lasting impression.<br><br>One can try it out with an outliner or a thin liner brush which are easily available. These brushes are available in a majority of general stores and come across in black and other shades.<br><br>Once the outline of a picture is drawn using this painting technique, an artist can choose to either add other colours to it or leave it in as-it-is format.<br><br>As for inspiration, one can literally pen down anything on the canvas ranging between abstract thoughts and practical ideas.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
       <h1 id="text1">Spray Painting </h1><img src="images\59.jpg" class="more_ideas_image">You may have already used a sprayer for a number of activities in your daily life. But, do you know you can also use a Spray painting to breathe new life into your old fabrics!<br><br>Wondering how you can do that? It’s simple - add the liquid colour of any shade to a small sprayer bottle and blow designs on a piece of cloth either by splashing it away or by using a straw.<br><br>If you wish to achieve the special or professional effect which you normally see on designer fabrics, opt for spray fabric paint.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
       <h1 id="text1">Block Painting</h1><img src="images\60.jpg" class="more_ideas_image">Block painting is the method of using stamps to leave the imprints of various designs on a piece of fabric.<br><br>One of the most common examples of this form of painting is vegetable block painting that can be applied on fabrics to transform plain-looking clothes into work of art!<br><br>As for stamps, you can cut vegetables into different shapes and sizes and make use of them to create appealing designs. Yes, that’s right.  Cut vegetables such as potato or ladies finger to see or feel the magical effect yourself.<br><br>Also, you can contemplate employing wooden stamps instead of using vegetables. They are equally good for the decoration of garments.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
       <h1 id="text1">Watercolor Painting </h1><img src="images\61.jpg" class="more_ideas_image">If you already know the basics of painting and have been to it for some time, you are the right candidate to try out this challenging format of fabric painting known as Watercolor Painting.<br><br>Here, you will be required to use paint in the same way as you use water colours. It is also called Watercolor painting as it relies on the flow of water based colours to create beautiful and interesting combinations.<br><br>There are two things you need to bear in mind - add water to the paint in a liberal amount and wet the area which is close to the outline so the colour does not spread out of the outline.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Fabric painting can be a perfect stress-relieving hobby and guess what – you can also learn to transform this creative activity into a money making hobby!</b><br><br><hr class="solid1">
