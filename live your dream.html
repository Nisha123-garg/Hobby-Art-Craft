      <blockquote>You can also turn your dream into a business just like I did. My passion is crafts. I love to do anything that has to do with crafts. I think I have tried just about every craft there is. One of the things I haven't done is to make my own pottery (but I am thinking about it).<br><br>My name is Shirley Atkinson and I would like to tell you how I turned my passion into a business.<br><br>My husband was a woodworker when we got married, so he has been working with wood most of his life. I had been doing crafts for a lot of years but had never done woodworking. Well you guessed it! I started doing some very simple wood projects and loved it. I soon advanced in to scroll work and then Intarsia. I was a stay at home mom so I needed a way to supplement our income. I decided to start doing craft shows to make a little extra money. I have many stories about some shows. There were good ones and bad ones and the only way you can find out is to do them yourself. We finally weeded out the bad ones and then we were on our way. They were a lot of fun and we really enjoyed doing them.<br><br>The only problem was that they were a lot of work. It took a long time to set up our booth and then to tear it down when the show was over. We weren't getting any younger.<br>

      <h2 class="head">My first web site</h2><br>After our kids were grown and started a life of their own we wondered what to do with our extra time. My husband retired and we didn’t want to just set around so Art said,<p style="color: purple;">“Why don’t you build a website?" That way you can share what you have learned with other home crafters.” </p><br>Well I did. I built a web site and then waited for people to come visit. Boy, was I in for an eye opener. <b>No one came!</b><br>So, I researched everything I could fine on how to set up a web site. I needed to know how to get a hosting company, how to get a domain name, and everything else that was important.<br>It was a slow process learning about domain names, hosting companies etc. and I felt like I was slowly moving towards my dream of a prefect website.<br>The only problem was that I wasn’t getting any traffic. So, I went out and started buying all kinds of information on how to make my website grow. All I did was to make other people rich by buying their books.<br>I'd gotten to the point that I wanted to share my knowledge but I couldn’t figure out how. They told me that I needed to advertise my site but how do you do that without spending a lot of money?
      <h2 class="head">The solution to my problem</h2><br>
      One day when I was surfing the web I stumbled across SBI. I liked what they said but I already had a web site. I mean what could they show me! Well after a while I finally figured out that they were the solution to my problem.<br>My instincts were right. Once I landed on SiteSell.com , it felt like the missing piece to a puzzle falling into place. The more I read, the more my life felt as if it had changed.<br>I told my husband about my SBI! discovery. I had to get the purchase approved by my husband since I had (ummmurrrhhhh!!) wasted so much money already on programs that did not work. By this time, my husband was at the<p style="color: purple;">"not another one"</p> stage. But he was also impressed by SBI! and he offered his support. I must say that I was nervous the day I purchased SBI!. But since the day I bought my subscription to SBI!, I have never looked back.<br>So, <p style="color: purple;">I decided to start over</p> using their web hosting and their ideas on how to come up with a web site name. They walked me through everything I needed and made it so easy for me to set up my new site. I didn’t even have to buy a web site package like FrontPage or Publisher as they have an online tool that I just enter in my content and then press a “build it” button and their system builds the page instantly for me.<br>It just couldn’t be easier. They do all the technical stuff so I just have to concentrate on the content. They also registered my domain name, crafterslovecrafts.com for no additional charge.<br></blockquote>

      <blockquote><b>If you’ve got some spare time,</b> you should give it a try. I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t use it myself.<br>Just what are your passions? What do you really like? Do you camp, hike, fish, or maybe collect marbles or dolls? Have a look at the Video Tour to get an idea of how it works. Not a joke here! You would be amazed at what other people like and how many like the same things. 
      <br><br>Just look around the Internet and you will find what other peoples' hobbies are. But the crucial difference is, they've turned their hobbies and passions into businesses.<br><br>The host I used, SBI, <b><em>is completely risk free.</em></b> SiteSell.com will give you a FULL refund if it's not for you, and there's no "trial period" or any sneaky catches.<br>I am now making a pretty good living working from home. You have nothing to lose but some time and it will pay off.<br><br>SBI stands for Site Build It! and helps you to turn any hobby, passion or skill into a viable online business. You probably don't even realise that almost any topic can make money with a website.<br><br>Build a website?! Exactly. Remember, I was relatively new to computers and the internet world. This website was built with SBI, so you see... anyone can do it.<br><br>I have a free gift for you. NOW FREE! Make Your Knowledge Sell!
